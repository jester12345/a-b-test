# a-b-test
Sample A/B Testing application. This is a programming challenge that I submitted. It has some very specific requirements for it's behavior.
It's useful as a sample of my coding, but has no practical value to anyone wanting to do real A/B testing or form validation.

## Tools Used
* Foundation
* Sass
* ES2015 w/Babel
* Grunt (sass, post_css, babel, watch)
